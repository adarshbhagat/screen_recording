# screen_recording
In this the screen will be recorded till we kill the program. and the recorded video will be saved in the location of this file.
All you need for this simple work is 3 libraries:-
1. numpy
2. opencv
3. pyautogui

screenshots are taken using pyauogui library function and that screenshot is used as a frame of the video
hence continuous screenshots are combined and saved as video..
